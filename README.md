# SpatialModelling folder

The contents of this repository contain code for redoing analyses of Bergmann et al. The code is split into two parts:

1) Standard bioinformatics (primarily in R) in the Bioinformatics folder

This folder contains code used to process the data, as well as various code for loading and analysnig the data, producing plots etc. 

2) Custom package for loading andd interogating the spatial data (written in Matlab) in the SpatialModelling foolder

This is custom code for loading in and visualising gene expression in 1D/2D/3D, as well as projecting other sources of data on to the embryos
