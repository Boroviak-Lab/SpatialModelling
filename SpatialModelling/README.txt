# Spatial modelling

1) Reconstruction of surfaces and subsequent projection of samples onto reconstructed tissue surfaces was done using custom scripts (Projections subfolder)

2) 3D reconstruction of expression patterns from projected samples can be done with Marmoset_3DPlot.m

3) 2D reconstruction of tissues at chosen plane bisections can be done using Marmoset_SurfacePlot.m
