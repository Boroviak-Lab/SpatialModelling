# Spatial modelling

1) Reconstruction of surfaces and subsequent projection of samples onto reconstructed tissue surfaces was done using custom scripts (Projections subfolder)

2) 3D reconstruction of expression patterns from projected samples can be done with the FinalEmModelling script

3) 2D reconstruction of tissues at chosen plane bisections can be done using XXXs

4) Projection of pluripotent stem cell correlations with embryo using GPR can be done using script XXX
